# fileManager


The File Management System In Java is a document manager that helps you keep your files in order by keeping them all together. You can easily manage and retrieve your files using this system. You can easily run this file with the use of any code editor like NetBeans and Eclipse.

A file management system has a limited number of features and is designed to help people or groups of people keep track of their own or other files, like special office documents and records. It might show things like who owns the report, when it was made, how far along it is, and other things that would be useful in an office.
